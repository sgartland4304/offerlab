# Mux Player Minimal

A minimal Mux video player with a custom play/pause button.

## Features

- **Custom play/pause button** — 44px circle, bottom-left, visible on hover (and when paused, for touch)
- **Click/tap anywhere** on the video to play or pause
- **No other controls** — all default Mux Player controls hidden
- **Transparent frame** — no lightbox, dialog, or loading overlay

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser or serve it locally.

## Note on Playback ID

The player uses `playback-id="007PdmD3qoSHO00u00kRXIZjq8Ap7bWpz5rm75ZtuMhzuM (playback ID; asset ID is different)"`. If your Mux asset uses a different playback ID, update this value in the HTML. You can find the playback ID in the [Mux Dashboard](https://dashboard.mux.com) under your asset’s details.
