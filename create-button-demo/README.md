# Create Button Demo

Duplicate of the OfferLab header UI with the **updated Create button** (Figma-style, with + icon) for sharing.

## What’s inside

- **index.html** – Page that mirrors the main container and header layout, with the new “Create New” button that includes the + icon SVG.

## How to view

Open `index.html` in a browser (or use a local server). The Create button is visible at **lg breakpoint and up** (1024px); resize the window or inspect in desktop size to see it.

## Button markup

The button uses the same classes as production (`button-primary-dark`, `button-small`, etc.) and adds an inline + icon SVG so you can copy the block into the real app when ready.
